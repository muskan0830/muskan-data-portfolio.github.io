										<h2>Data-Driven Customer Review Analysis for British Airways || Python</h2>

									<p>In the vast landscape of data, my recent expedition involved embarking on a journey through British Airways
										customer reviews. Armed with Python's formidable libraries—<code>BeautifulSoup</code>, <code>Requests</code>,
										and <code>Pandas</code>—I set out to uncover the sentiments and nuances within a treasure trove of a thousand
										customer testimonials.</p>
								
									<h3>The Quest:</h3>
									<p>The quest's objective was clear: to glean insights from the collective voice of British Airways passengers,
										encapsulated in reviews scattered across the digital realm. This data analyst adventure unfolded in three
										distinct chapters.</p>
								
									<h4>Chapter 1: Web Scraping Odyssey:</h4>
									<p>In the first chapter, I harnessed the power of web scraping. Armed with Python, I summoned <code>BeautifulSoup</code>
										and <code>Pandas</code> as my companions. Together, we ventured into the expanse of British Airways reviews,
										meticulously collecting and parsing HTML content. The result? A trove of a thousand reviews transformed into a
										structured Pandas DataFrame, ready for the next leg of the journey.</p>
								
									<h4>Chapter 2: Data Cleaning Chronicles:</h4>
									<p>As any seasoned explorer would attest, the road to insights is often paved with data cleaning challenges. With
										Pandas as my guide, I navigated through the DataFrame, exploring its dimensions, handling null values, and
										bidding farewell to irrelevant columns. The reviews underwent a metamorphosis, shedding unwanted patterns
										through the mystic arts of the <code>re</code> module. Sentiment analysis, powered by <code>TextBlob</code>,
										added a layer of emotional depth to each review, and categorization painted a vivid picture of passenger
										experiences.</p>
								
									<h4>Chapter 3: Analytical Odyssey:</h4>
									<p>The final chapter, a grand finale, involved the analytical unraveling of the British Airways narrative. Reviews
										were grouped by category, sentiments were labeled, and percentages danced on the canvas of positivity and
										negativity. A pivot table emerged, a mosaic of sentiment counts for each category, and a Pandas DataFrame
										transformed this mosaic into a structured masterpiece. Categories were sorted by the echoes of passenger voices,
										and the story was etched into a CSV file—<code>cleaned_reviews_analysis.csv</code>—an artifact of the analytical
										odyssey.</p>

						
								    <h4> Key Insights: </h4>
											
												<h4>Customer Feedback Analysis</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p><b>Service Category:</b> Unraveling like a magician's act, "Service" steals the spotlight with a dazzling 45.70% of total reviews. It's not just a flight; it's a performance worth applauding!</p></li>
												
												<li><p><b>Staff:</b> Representing a modest 8.20% of reviews, the staff category suggests room for improvement. Perhaps a sprinkle of humor in in-flight announcements could turn those frowns upside down.</p></li></ul>
											
												<h4>Sentiment Analysis</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p>The majority of reviews (64.50%) are like a chorus of cheerful birds, singing praises for British Airways. It seems like passengers are more "yay" than "nay"!</p></li>
												<li><p>Constituting 34.40% of reviews, the negative sentiment is like that one cloud on an otherwise sunny day. A sprinkle of humor could turn those clouds into silver linings.</p></li>
												<li><p>So, it's safe to say, British Airways has more fans than a blockbuster movie premiering at 30,000 feet.</p></li></ul>
									
												<h4>Additional Revelations, Because Why Not?</h4>
													
													  <p><b>Customer Applause</b></p>
													  <ul>
													  <li><p>High-fives all around for the "Service" category. It's not just good; it's "call-your-mom-and-tell-her-about-it" good.</p></li>
													  <li><p>Positive vibes also detected in the "Food" and "Other" categories. It's official; in-flight snacks are the unsung heroes of air travel!</p></li></ul>
													
													  <p><b>Areas for Improvement (Cue Dramatic Music)</b></p>
													  <ul>
													 <li> <p>"Comfort" is like that one character in a sitcom who needs a glow-up. Let's give it a makeover, shall we?</p></li>
													 <li> <p>Negative reviews are like grumpy cats on the internet - impossible to ignore. Time to turn those frowns upside down, BA style!</p></li></ul>
